# Power Manager Home Assistant Addon

This is a power manager for single SAX Battery to allow performant steering via ModbusTCP and integration into HA. It requires an Modbus RTU to Modbus TCP gateway to query the ADL400 via ModbusTCP and requires the HA MQTT addon / integration.

Hint: There is also an HA integration with more functionality. Please try to consider using this integration instead of this highly customized addon.
